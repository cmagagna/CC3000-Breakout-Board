CC3000 Breakout
=============

<p>Version 1.3</p>

<p>Yet another breakout board for the TI CC3000 WiFi module</p>

<p>Based on a design & library by Matt Bigarani, http://www.centerblack.com</p>

<p>The antenna used by Matt from the SparkFun-RF library was the wrong size. SparkFun had one that was close (ANTENNA-CHIP5) but wasn't exactly right so I modified the part in their library. The modified library is now included in this project as SparkFun-RF-Modified.lbr</p>
